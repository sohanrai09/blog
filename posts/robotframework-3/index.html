</code></pre><p>As you can see, there are a lot of keywords this time! As mentioned earlier, I&rsquo;m using Junos PyEz here and the RPCs it offers to interact with the device. Although I&rsquo;m not going go over each line of this code, as it is quite straight forward, I would still like to mention couple of them. <code>cfg_back</code> is a function to retrieve the current configuration in given format(json,set,xml) and back it up to a file. I&rsquo;m using the RPC <code>get_config()</code> here, which extracts the configuration in given format but the output of RPC is still in xml. So a couple of lines of code to sanitize the output from device and store it in a file named after the <code>hostname</code> of the Device Under Testing (DUT). Please refer Junos PyEz <a href=https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos-pyez/junos-pyez-developer/topics/topic-map/junos-pyez-program-configuration-retrieving.html>documentation</a> to know more about retrieving configuration from a device.</p><p><code>configuration</code> function is used to make required configuration changes on the device. Junos PyEz has an utility named <code>Config</code> which I will be using here to make the configuration changes. To generate the required configuration, <code>jinja2</code> template is used and the required variables are taken from the Variables file. <code>template_path</code> is the location of the jinja2 template and <code>template_vars</code> is the dictionary of variables for the jinja2 template which here comes from Variables file. More information on the Junos PyEz <code>Config</code> utility can be found <a href=https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos-pyez/junos-pyez-developer/topics/concept/junos-pyez-configuration-process-and-data-formats.html>here</a></p><pre tabindex=0><code>set interfaces {{ name }} unit {{ unit }} description &#34;{{ descr }}&#34;

<a class=anchor href=#keywords>#</a></h3><p><code>Keywords</code> file is a collection of Keywords, having a Keywords file separately rather than defining Keywords in Test Suite itself is quite handy. Same Keywords file can be re-used in multiple Test Suites and any new Keyword would be added here to make it readily available in all the Test Suites using this Keywords file. And since this is a <code>robot</code> file, we can make use of various <a href=https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html>builtin</a> keywords available in RF.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>*** Keywords ***

</code></pre><p>Again, quite a few Keywords but if you look closely, they are all similar, so let&rsquo;s go over a couple of them. <code>Interface Up Count</code> as documentation states, is used to check and verify the number of UP interfaces. This Keyword expects one argument, <code>${device}</code> which will be passed from Test Suite file. <code>${int_up}</code> is the variable used to hold the output from the Keyword <code>Intf Up Count</code>, which is nothing but a function defined in the Resource file, shown below for quick reference.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>def intf_up_count(device):
    intf_xml = device.rpc.get_interface_information(terse=True)

    logical_count = intf_xml.xpath(&#34;.//physical-interface/logical-interface[oper-status=&#39;\nup\n&#39;]&#34;)
    return len(physical_up_count)+len(logical_count)
</code></pre><p>Output from the function/keyword is then passed to the builtin keyword <code>should be equal</code> to compare the extracted value with the expected value <code>${interface_count}</code>, dictionary named <code>interface</code> with the key <code>up_count</code> in the Variables file.</p><p>Keyword <code>Configuration Device</code> is worth taking a look as well, this one expects two arguments <code>${device}</code> and <code>${config_vars}</code>. As mentioned earlier, <code>${config_vars}</code> is a dictionary with variables required by jinja2 template to generate the required configuration. This keyword returns 2 values, one if the configuration was successful or not and two the configuration difference between the running and candidate config.</p><h3 id=test-suite>Test Suite
<a class=anchor href=#test-suite>#</a></h3><p>Everything comes together now in the Test Suite file, let&rsquo;s break it down and take a look at it in sections.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>*** Settings ***

This is used to execute anything before running the Test Cases in the Test Suite, and in this case we will be initiating the connection to the device as a part of <code>Suite Setup</code>. Similarly, we have <code>Suite Teardown</code> which is executed after all the Test Cases are executed.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>*** Keywords ***

I have included 3 Test Cases, one to check the network state before change, two to make the configuration change and three to check the network state post change to validate.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>*** Test Cases ***

In this case, we are checking if variable <code>${configure.save_cfg}</code> is set to <code>True</code>, this value again comes from the Variables file.

</code></pre><p>We see all our 3 Test Cases were executed with Test Case <code>TC - Post checks after the configuration change</code> failing, we will come back to this but before that, let&rsquo;s appreciate the Test Case <code>TC - Configuring the device</code> shall we? We see the TC passed, which means the configuration on the device was successful and we also see a config difference being printed out, neat, right?</p><p>Now coming to the failure, from the execution we see that TestCase <code>TC - Post checks after the configuration change</code> failed, which means some check in <code>Sanity Checks</code> failed. We can also see <code>0 != 3</code> is the reason for failure, but it is not clear from here what exactly failed. As I have mentioned in my earlier posts as well, the best thing about using RF for testing, in my opinion, is the logs and reports being available in html, makes it easy to view in a browser. Checking the <a href=/html/report_3.html><code>report</code></a> generated for our Test Execution, we can clearly see that out of our 3 TCs, 2 Passed and 1 Failed. Now looking at the <a href=/html/log_3.html><code>log</code></a>, we can see <code>Test Suite Setup</code> and <code>Test Suite Teardown</code>, expanding the sections, we can see what exactly happened.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at couple of sections together, rest you should be able to explore yourself as it is quite intuitive.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/sohanrai09/blog/blob/main/images/log3_1.png?raw=true" alt=log1></p><p>I have highlighted couple of things to make it easy to look, first one is where we see the device object being returned by Junos PyEz. Second one is where we see the variable which has the device object being set as <code>Suite Variable</code>, documentation makes it clear!</p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s take a look at one of checks being done in TC 1, <code>TC - Pre checks before the configuration change & config backup</code></p><p><img src="https://github.com/sohanrai09/blog/blob/main/images/log3_2.png?raw=true" alt=log2></p><p>Here we see keyword <code>Sanity Checks</code> getting executed first, within which we have several keywords. Moving to <code>Ospf Neighbor Count</code> keyword, we can see <code>Ospf Nbr Count</code> being called which is defined in our Python file. This keyword or function returns the number of OSPF Neighbors in Full state, which in this is case is 3. Next, we see our verification <code>Should Be Equal</code>, checking if the value we defined is equal to the extracted value.</p><p>Moving to Test Case <code>TC - Post checks after the configuration change</code>, where the failure occurred, let&rsquo;s see if we can make sense of the failure.
<img src=/images/log3_3.png alt=log3>
We can see that failure is seen in <code>Ospf Neighbor Count</code> keyword, we can see <code>Ospf Nbr Count</code> returning 0, which means there are no OSPF neighbors on the device in Full State. Due to this our verification fails as our expected value is 3 but the extracted value is 0! Checking on the device, we can see why.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/sohanrai09/blog/blob/main/static/images/router.png?raw=true" alt=router></p><p>We see all our OSPF neighbors in <code>Exstart</code> state! Looking closely at the configuration changes made.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/sohanrai09/blog/blob/main/static/images/config.png?raw=true" alt=config></p><p>One of our changes included changing the MTU value to 1400 for a group, ALL, which is being applied on the all the interfaces!</p><p>This may not have been a particularly difficult issue to troubleshoot manually but using RF we were able to test and ensure if our change was successful or not. Let&rsquo;s say you want to add few more checks to your Test Suite, just write Python functions and create keywords in <code>Keywords</code> file, easy! Or you are performing a Software Upgrade and want to run some pre and post checks to ensure nothing is broken, you can write a Test Suite like this to automate the checks and the upgrade itself!</p><p>I know there was a lot to go through in this post, I highly recommend having the <a href=https://github.com/sohanrai09/robotframework/tree/main/robotframework-3>code</a> in front of you to help you understand better. I hope I have been clear in explaining everything, if not, please reach out to me with your feedback so that I can do a better job next time.</p><h3 id=reference>Reference
