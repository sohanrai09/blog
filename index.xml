As I&amp;rsquo;m going through this learning journey, I wanted to blog about it for anyone who is looking to start this journey and also to help me understand things in a better way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are plenty of good resources out there which explains the Robot Framework and it&amp;rsquo;s components. Best place to start would be the &lt;a href="https://robotframework.org/">Robot Framework Documentation&lt;/a>, which shows some interactive examples and very clear explaination. During my learning what I have come to realise is, there are lot of resources around Robot Framework used for Application Testing but there are not a lot of resources focused on Network Testing(or maybe I haven&amp;rsquo;t been thorough with my search!). That&amp;rsquo;s also one of the reaons for starting this blog, to give a Network Engineer&amp;rsquo;s perspective on Robot Framework and use the examples around networking to help us understand this better.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
