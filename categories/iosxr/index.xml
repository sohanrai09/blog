I have been testing Model Driven Telemetry(MDT) on Cisco&amp;rsquo;s IOS-XR for a while, so I wanted to share some of my learnings to help someone along their way for setting up telemetry. I will be primarily focusing on Cisco IOS-XR&amp;rsquo;s implementation of MDT, more precisely GRPC DIAL-OUT for now.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
