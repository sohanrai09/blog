But during the Annual shutdown of Dec &amp;lsquo;24, I had some spare time, so I wanted to set this up in my personal lab and play around. At work, I have been testing Model Driven Telemetry(MDT) on Cisco&amp;rsquo;s IOS-XR for a while now, so I wanted to share some of my learnings through this post. I will be primarily focusing on Cisco IOS-XR&amp;rsquo;s implementation of MDT, more precisely GRPC DIAL-OUT in this post.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
